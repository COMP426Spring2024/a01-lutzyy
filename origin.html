<h1>Origin of Kasa-Obake</h1>
<p>
    It’s believed that after 100 years, an everyday object can become an apparition. These are called tsukumogami, which might be the inspiration for this yokai. It isn’t a possible origin, but there are similarities. This can also be a lesson on why one should not discard old objects that may still have a use or some sentimental value.
